A complete traverse json function with `iterable` interface.

## Motivation

Many time I've encontered with the difficult task of traverse a object with nested properties by filtering some of them using a single function, so a `traverse-json` solves this using multiple options for traversing.


## Mutation

For mutation this library is part of [mutant-json](https://github.com/rubeniskov/mutant-json) which wraps this `traverse-json` to take the advantages of filtering options.

## Installation

### Npm:
```shell
npm install traverse-json --save
```
### Yarn:
```shell
yarn add traverse-json
```
